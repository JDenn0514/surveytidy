\title{Rename columns of a survey design object}
\usage{
rename.survey_base(.data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{\link[surveycore:survey_base]{survey_base}} object.}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[tidyselect:language]{tidy-select}}> Use \code{new_name = old_name}
pairs to rename columns. Any number of columns can be renamed in a
single call.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{.data} with the following properties:
\itemize{
\item Rows are not added or removed.
\item Column order is preserved.
\item Renamed columns are updated in \verb{@data}, \verb{@variables}, and \verb{@metadata}.
\item Groups and survey design attributes are preserved.
}
}
\description{
\code{rename()} changes column names in the underlying data and automatically
keeps the survey design in sync. Variable labels, value labels, and other
metadata follow the rename — no manual bookkeeping required.

Renaming a design variable (weights, strata, PSUs) is fully supported:
the design specification updates automatically and a
\code{surveytidy_warning_rename_design_var} warning is issued to confirm the
change.
}
\details{
\subsection{What gets updated}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Column names in \verb{@data}} — the rename takes effect immediately.
\item \strong{Design specification} — if a renamed column is a design variable
(weights, strata, PSU, FPC, or replicate weights), \verb{@variables} is
updated to track the new name.
\item \strong{Metadata} — variable labels, value labels, question prefaces, notes,
and transformation records in \verb{@metadata} are re-keyed to the new name.
\item \strong{\code{visible_vars}} — any occurrence of the old name in
\verb{@variables$visible_vars} is replaced with the new name, so
\code{\link[=select]{select()}} + \code{rename()} pipelines work correctly.
}
}

\subsection{Renaming design variables}{

Renaming a design variable (e.g., the weights column) is intentionally
allowed. A \code{surveytidy_warning_rename_design_var} warning is issued as a
reminder that the design specification has been updated — not to indicate
an error.

\examples{
library(surveytidy)
library(surveycore)
d <- as_survey(pew_npors_2025, weights = weight, strata = stratum)

# Rename an outcome column
rename(d, financial_situation = fin_sit)

# Rename multiple columns at once
rename(d, region = cregion, education = educcat)

# Rename a design variable — warns and updates the design specification
rename(d, survey_weight = weight)

\title{Keep or drop columns using their names and types}
\usage{
select.survey_base(.data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{\link[surveycore:survey_base]{survey_base}} object.}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[tidyselect:language]{tidy-select}}> One or more unquoted
column names or tidy-select expressions.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{.data} with the following properties:
\itemize{
\item Rows are not modified.
\item Non-selected, non-design columns are permanently removed.
\item Design variables are always retained.
\item Survey design attributes are preserved.
}
}
\description{
\code{select()} keeps the named columns and drops all others, using the
\link[tidyselect:language]{tidyselect mini-language} to describe column sets.
Design variables (weights, strata, PSU, FPC, replicate weights) are
\strong{always retained} even when not explicitly selected — they are required
for variance estimation. After \code{select()}, \code{print()} shows only the columns
you selected; design variables remain in the object but are hidden from
display.

\code{select()} is irreversible: dropped columns are permanently removed from
the survey object and cannot be recovered within the same pipeline.
}
\details{
\subsection{Design variable preservation}{

Regardless of what you select, the following are always kept in the
survey object: weights, strata, PSUs, FPC columns, replicate weights,
and the domain column (if set by \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}}). They are hidden from
\code{print()} output but remain available for variance estimation.
}

\subsection{Metadata}{

Variable labels, value labels, and other metadata for dropped columns
are removed. Metadata for retained columns is preserved.

\examples{
library(surveytidy)
library(surveycore)
d <- as_survey(pew_npors_2025, weights = weight, strata = stratum)

# Select by name
select(d, gender, agecat)

# Select by name pattern
select(d, dplyr::starts_with("smuse_"))

# Select by type
select(d, dplyr::where(is.numeric))

# Drop columns with !
select(d, !dplyr::starts_with("smuse_"))

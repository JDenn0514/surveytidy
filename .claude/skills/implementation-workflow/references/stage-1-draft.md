# Stage 1: Drafting the Implementation Plan

Only start this stage when the user explicitly says the spec is finalized.

## Before Writing Anything

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather context:

```
questions:
  - question: "Which spec is this plan for? I'll read it before drafting."
    header: "Spec location"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "I'll provide the file path"
        description: "Share the path so I can read the full spec first."
      - label: "It's already in context from this session"
        description: "The spec content is visible in this conversation."

  - question: "Is there a spec-review output file to check scope against?"
    header: "Review file"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "Yes — plans/spec-review-phase-{X}.md exists"
        description: "I'll verify all BLOCKING and REQUIRED issues were resolved before drafting."
      - label: "No — spec was reviewed informally"
        description: "Draft directly from the spec."

  - question: "Any PR sequencing constraints I should know about?"
    header: "Constraints"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "No — follow standard ordering"
        description: "Shared infrastructure first, then verbs in spec order."
      - label: "Yes — I'll describe them"
        description: "Provide ordering requirements before I start."
```

Read the spec in full before writing a single line of the plan. If a
spec-review file exists, skim it to confirm no BLOCKING issues remain open.

## Plan Structure

The implementation plan is a separate document from the spec. Required sections:

**Overview** — 2–3 sentences: what this plan delivers and how it relates to
the spec.

**PR map** — A checkbox list of every planned PR. Use this exact format so
`r-implement` can read and check off sections:

```
- [ ] PR 1: `feature/branch-name` — one-sentence description
- [ ] PR 2: `feature/branch-name` — one-sentence description
```

Rules for the PR map:

- **One PR per logical unit of work.** For dplyr verbs: one PR per verb (or
  tightly related pair like `arrange` + `slice_*`). Never bundle unrelated verbs
  into one PR.
- Shared infrastructure (helpers, test helpers) ships in its own PR before
  the verbs that depend on it.
- No PR should contain more than ~3 new R files + their test files.
- `devtools::document()` and `devtools::check()` must pass before every PR.

**Per-PR sections** — For each PR in the map:

```markdown
### PR [N]: [Human-readable title]

**Branch:** `feature/[name]`
**Depends on:** PR [n] (or "none")

**Files:**
- `R/[file].R` — [one-sentence description]
- `tests/testthat/test-[file].R` — [one-sentence description]
- `changelog/phase-{X}/feature-[name].md` — created last, before opening PR

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `devtools::check()` 0 errors, 0 warnings, ≤2 pre-approved notes
- [ ] `devtools::document()` run; NAMESPACE and man/ in sync
- [ ] [specific test categories that must pass for this PR]
- [ ] All three design types tested via `make_all_designs()`
- [ ] Domain column preservation asserted
- [ ] Changelog entry written and committed on this branch

**Notes:** [Implementation details, gotchas, ordering constraints not in the
spec — anything the implementor needs that isn't obvious from the spec text.]
```

## After the Draft

Tell the user:

> "Review the PR map carefully — the scope of each PR is harder to change
> once implementation starts. In particular, confirm that no PR bundles verbs
> that should be separate. Run Stage 2 in a new session for an adversarial
> review of this plan before handing off to `/r-implement`."

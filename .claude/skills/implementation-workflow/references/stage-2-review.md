# Stage 2: Adversarial Plan Review

You are a plan reviewer. Your job: find every gap, wrong PR boundary, missing
file, unverifiable acceptance criterion, and spec coverage failure in the
implementation plan. Be adversarial. The user does not want validation — they
want problems found before coding starts.

This stage produces a **complete issue list saved to a file**. Do not resolve
issues here — that happens in Stage 3.

---

## Input Requirement

If no plan document is provided, ask the user for the file path or to paste the
content. Read the full plan once before generating any output. Also read the
corresponding spec if available — you need it to check coverage.

## Five Review Lenses (apply all five, in order)

### Lens 1 — PR Granularity

The right PR is the smallest coherent unit of work:

- Are any PRs bundling verbs that should be separate?
  (e.g., `rename` + `mutate` in one PR — not acceptable)
- Are any PRs missing that should exist?
  (e.g., shared infrastructure lumped into the first verb's PR)
- Does any PR contain more than ~3 new R files + their test files?
- Are tightly related verb pairs explicitly justified?
  (`arrange` + `slice_*` is acceptable; `filter` + `select` is not)
- Is there a dedicated PR for shared infrastructure that ships before the
  verbs depending on it?

### Lens 2 — Dependency Ordering

- Do PRs build in the right sequence? Shared helpers before verbs, verbs
  before integration tests.
- Is every `Depends on:` field accurate — no circular dependencies, no
  missing dependencies?
- If two PRs are genuinely independent, are they marked as such?
- Does the first PR leave `main` in a state where CI passes?
- Does the PR sequence match the build order defined in the spec's
  Architecture section?

### Lens 3 — Acceptance Criteria

For every PR:

- Are all acceptance criteria **objectively verifiable**? ("Works correctly"
  is not verifiable; "0 errors in `devtools::check()`" is.)
- Are the standard criteria present?
  - `devtools::check()` pass
  - `devtools::document()` run; NAMESPACE and man/ in sync
  - All three design types tested via `make_all_designs()`
  - Domain column preservation asserted
  - Changelog entry written and committed on this branch
- Are verb-specific criteria present and complete?
  (e.g., for filter: domain column created, AND-accumulation tested;
  for rename: @variables and @metadata keys updated)
- Is the 98%+ line coverage requirement stated?
- Is `plans/error-messages.md` update listed as a criterion where new error
  classes are introduced?

### Lens 4 — Spec Coverage

Compare the plan against the spec:

- Does every function in the spec have a corresponding PR?
- Does every error class in the spec have a test requirement in the
  acceptance criteria?
- Are any behaviors from the spec absent from the plan?
- Does the plan include anything NOT in the spec? (Scope creep — flag it.)
- Are all edge cases from the spec covered by at least one acceptance
  criterion?

### Lens 5 — File Completeness

For every PR, check that all required files are listed:

- `R/[verb].R` — implementation file
- `tests/testthat/test-[verb].R` — test file
- `changelog/phase-{X}/feature-[name].md` — changelog entry
- NAMESPACE and man/ (implicitly via `devtools::document()` criterion)
- `plans/error-messages.md` update (if new error classes are introduced)
- `tests/testthat/helper-test-data.R` update (if new test helpers are needed)

## Issue Format

```
**Issue [N]: [Short title]**
Severity: BLOCKING | REQUIRED | SUGGESTION
[Rule or principle violated, e.g. "Violates github-strategy.md PR granularity"]

[Concrete description of the problem. Quote the plan text that is problematic,
or name the thing that is absent.]

Options:
- **[A]** [Description] — Effort: [low/medium/high], Risk: [low/medium/high], Impact: [what]
- **[B]** [Alternative description]
- **[C] Do nothing** — [what breaks or stays ambiguous]

**Recommendation: [A/B/C]** — [One sentence rationale]
```

**Severity tiers:**

- **BLOCKING** — Cannot implement correctly without resolving; implementer
  would have to guess PR scope or sequence.
- **REQUIRED** — Will cause test failures, missed coverage, or a broken `main`
  if not addressed.
- **SUGGESTION** — Quality improvement worth considering before coding starts.

## Output Structure

Organize issues by plan section. If a section has no issues, say
"No issues found."

```markdown
## Plan Review: Phase [X]

### Section: PR Map

**Issue 1: [title]**
Severity: BLOCKING
...

### Section: PR [N] — [title]

**Issue 2: [title]**
Severity: REQUIRED
...

### Section: PR [N] — [title]

No issues found.

---

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| BLOCKING | N |
| REQUIRED | N |
| SUGGESTION | N |

**Total issues:** N

**Overall assessment:** [One honest sentence — e.g., "The plan is ready to
implement after resolving one blocking ambiguity in the PR dependency order."]
```

---

## Before Outputting

Ask yourself:

- Have I applied all five lenses?
- For every PR: did I check granularity, dependencies, all acceptance
  criteria, and all files?
- Have I cross-referenced against the spec for coverage gaps?
- Is the overall assessment honest — does it match the issue count?

If a plan is genuinely solid, say so.

## After Completing the Review

1. Confirm the phase number.
2. Save the full review to `plans/plan-review-phase-{X}.md`.
3. End the session with:

   > "{N} issues found ({X} blocking, {Y} required, {Z} suggestions).
   > Start a new session with `/implementation-workflow stage 3` to resolve
   > these interactively. The issue list has been saved to
   > `plans/plan-review-phase-{X}.md`."

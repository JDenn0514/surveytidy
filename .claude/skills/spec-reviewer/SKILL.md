# Spec Reviewer (Redirected)

This skill has been absorbed into `spec-workflow`. Run:

```
/spec-workflow stage 2
```

All adversarial review content, issue format, output structure, and the five
review lenses are now in:

```
.claude/skills/spec-workflow/references/stage-2-review.md
```

The output file location is unchanged: `plans/spec-review-phase-{X}.md`.
After the review, resolve issues with `/spec-workflow stage 3`.

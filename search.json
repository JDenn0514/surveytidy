Reorders visible_vars prior select() called; reorders @data directly otherwise. pull() — extract column plain vector (terminal operation). glimpse() — concise column summary, respecting visible_vars. mutate() — add modify columns. Re-attaches design variables dropped .keep = \"none\" .keep = \"used\". Issues surveytidy_warning_mutate_design_var mutation’s left-hand side names design variable. Respects @groups set group_by(). rename() — rename columns. Automatically keeps @variables (design specification) @metadata (variable labels, value labels, etc.) sync new column names. Issues surveytidy_warning_rename_design_var design variable renamed. arrange() — row sorting. domain column moves correctly rows sorting. Supports .by_group = TRUE using @groups. slice(), slice_head(), slice_tail(), slice_min(), slice_max(), slice_sample() — physical row selection surveycore_warning_physical_subset warning. slice_sample(weight_by = ) additionally issues surveytidy_warning_slice_sample_weight_by flag weight_by column independent survey design weights. group_by() — store grouping columns @groups. attach grouped_df attribute @data; grouping kept survey object. Supports .add = TRUE incremental grouping computed expressions (e.g., group_by(d, above_median = y1 > median(y1))). ungroup() — remove groups (arguments) remove specific columns @groups (partial ungroup). drop_na() — physical row removal rows NA specified columns (column).
